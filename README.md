Using VHDL code and an Altera Quartus board, a virtual version of a tennis-style Pong game was conceived. Throughout construction of the program, we learned how to use a VGA display and practiced writing code that rendered correctly to the screen. 

This game requires two players. Both move their "racquet" avatar up and down on the court while the "tennis" ball bounces back and forth. To win a point, a player has to get the ball past the opposing player. The first player to get seven points wins, and the game restarts.
